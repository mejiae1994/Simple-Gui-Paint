# Simple-Gui-Paint
Simple Java Paint is a basic paint program built using the swing library that comes with Java. It uses the JPanel and the different Jcomponents included in the library, to allow the user to draw lines, change the size and color of lines. Furthermore, it allows users to draw certain shapes on the screen and to be able to erase the elements drawn on the screen.
